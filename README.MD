A very classy insult generator that generates random insults. Insults are not classy, but this is the classiest way to go about it.

## Project Description
This is my first project without using the training wheels of a tutorial for JavaScript. I did all the research and built the code myself, with some help from a friend if I got really stuck, but he's good at not giving me the entire code. I wanted to make something that was easy, because I was getting frustrated with figuring out keyboard inputs for a calculator, so I started this one to get my mind refreshed. 

The style was heavily influenced by Wes Anderson and his films. I had just recently binge watched a good amount of his films with my wife, so I wanted to use the motif he has in his work. 

The background image is from a Wes Anderson film called "The Grand Budapest Hotel." I covered up the movie title using the cloning tool in Photoshop.
